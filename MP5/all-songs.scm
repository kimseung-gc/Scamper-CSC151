(all-songs 5 five-note-example); It has a long running time, so becareful...

; I think that music is a type of subject that requires a lot of emotional
; aspects. For now, computers cannot represent human emotions yet, so modern 
; machines cannot judge the work that involves emotions. Thus, the modern 
; computers cannot yet be called as "do it all."

; First of all, computers cannot calculate humans' emotions, meaning they
; may not be able to accurately interpret whether a song is sad or happy.
; In that case, we can deduce that they may consider C major song and a 
; C minor song as copyright targets since they only have a minor difference.
; In human perspective, however, they have completely different moods which
; computers cannot compute. As a result, I think that it is too early to 
; state that we can totally rely on computers for musical analysis. According 
; to what I have heard from professors about the 8 note copyrights, I think
; they should have asked the musical professionals about it instead of 
; computers that cannot understand human emotions.

; Also, I think that if computers are implemented to the extent that it can
; create its own song, and based on what I did in the mini-project today,
; I do not understand why people are freaking out on whether computers converge
; as a "do it all" machine since we cannot create complex songs through only
; combinations since there exists approximately googol number songs with 12
; notes (the number of semitones in an octave) and length of 90. I see VS
; code collapsing due to stack over flow. Thus, I argue that it is too early 
; to say that computers are at "do it all" state.

; When it becomes the "do it all" state, however, I think that computers will
; be able to accurately calculate our emotions, and create decent songs. 
; Nevertheless, I would like to argue that reinforcement has its limits, so
; unless people find out a new way to interpret music that will interest
; other people, only computers in the musics field will make the beautiful
; music field that we currently have lost in our memories.
